Simplest Cold Wallet

This program allows you to create cold wallets of bitcoins.

NOTE: Download executable from https://github.com/MichelleStratcha/SimplestColdWallet/releases

Creating cold wallets is the safest way to keep your bitcoins away from the hands of others.

For added security, SimplestColdWallet can be run on a computer disconnected from the internet and the local network. After generating the wallet you can reconnect the computer.

SimplestColdWallet is a simple MS-DOS application with three options to choose from its menu.

The first option allows you to generate a 'private address / key' pair and display it on the screen.

The second option will generate the pair and save it in a text file.

The last option will allow saving the generated keys as a bitmap image with two QR codes, one for the public address and the other for the private key, which can be printed and stored in a safe place.

Once the pair is generated, transfer your bitcoins to the public address and save the generated private key. Your bitcoins will be safe until you decide to use them.

USE
---

Copy SimplestColdWallet.exe file anywhere and run it from there. Saved files (text and bmp) will be saved in the same directory.
